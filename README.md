The front end is structured using many different components. App.js renders Header and Maincontent, where maincontent in turn renders the appropriate URL that is pushed. In this way, the header will always be present and the necessary information will be filled in. Each component in turn contains its own CSS file where unique design is created for each part.


Inspiration:
To develop this app, inspiration is taken from Todo tutorial, link is below.
Bootstrap has been used for buttons and design.
MUI components has also been used.
